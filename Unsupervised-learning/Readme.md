
# Dimensionality reduction of lung cancer cell type expression.


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]
The purpose of this project is dive into the basics of unsupervised machine learning and maintain a proper approach to do machine learning research. 
## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is dive into the basics of unsupervised machine learning and maintain a proper approach to do machine learning research. 
Read the two datasets in and conduct proper preprocessing. Combine the clinical data with the genetic data. Use unsupervised learning to develop an accurate machine learning model that can predict lung cancer. Explain your choices. Make sure you properly inspect and preprocessing the data. (Check for missing data, skewness, distribution, sample, linearity, correlations etc.). Use an argumentative approach.

## Project Description
This unsupervised learning assignment focuses on the dimensionality reduction for the prediction of lung cancer cell type differentiation by cluster analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here]([Repo folder containing raw data](https://github.com/DaLuSt/DSLS-DS3-Machine-learning/tree/main/Unsupervised-learning/data)) within this repo.
    
5. Open the jupyter notebook and run all (No manual input should be required)
