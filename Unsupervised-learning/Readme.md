
# Projet name
Load, inspect and clean the data. Split the data into a training set and a validation set and a test set. Use a simple classifier as a baseline. Train various classifiers. Motivate your choice in relation to the characteristics of the dataset. Try to combine them into an ensemble learning model that outperforms all of the others

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is deve into the basics of supervised machine learning and maintain a propper approach to do machine learning research. 

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning (Supervised)
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* jupyter notebook
* sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
* exploration.py (In repo itself)

## Project Description
This supervised machine learning assignment takes a shot at predicting Blood Pressure Abnormality based on patients analytics. The created model can in future be used to to make health predictions based on a patrients seeminly basic health statistics. This way potential health issues can be detected before they become a problem. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here]([Repo folder containing raw data](https://github.com/DaLuSt/DSLS-DS3-Machine-learning/blob/main/Supervised-learning/data.csv)) within this repo.
    
5. Open the jupyter notebook and run all (No manual input should be required)
